# GAD405
My assignments program is a very simple but interesting concept, the program draws Circle, Rectangular and triangular targerts 
depending on the mouses click: 
- Left Mouse Button = Triangles 
- Middle Mouse button = Rectangles
- Program Default - Circles

These targets/ shapes are coloured either through random values put through an array or are pick by the user to choose the colour and
those values are then put into a different array, which then then assigns the values to the shapes via RGB values (0 - 255).
